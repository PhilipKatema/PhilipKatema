## Brief Bio
<p>I started my career in 2014 as a Data Entry Clerk with an NGO, Baobab Health Trust based in Blantyre, Malawi on Data System Transitioning Project. I was part of a team that was responsible for the transition of medical data in Government health facilities from paper-based records to an Electronic Management System. I eventually rose to the position of Data Supervisor, where I was responsible for training and managing a team of 10 - 20 data clerks on the same project.</p>
<p>Then in 2017, I joined an International NGO, Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders), based in Blantyre, Malawi where I was employed as a Data Analyst responsible for managing all the data processes on a Key Population Project focused on HIV and TB management until phasing out of the project in 2020.</p>
<p>In 2021 I joined another Project with the same organization where I worked as a Data Analyst managing data for Cervical Cancer Patients until June 2022. In July 2022, I was promoted to the position of Data Analyst Manager in another project focused on a cohort of over 20,000 Advanced HIV/TB patients. I managed a team of 5 Data Analysts and 8 Data Entry Clerks until the Project phased out in August 2023.</p>
<p>I then joined Invisible Technologies in May 2024 as an Advanced AI Data Trainer on an independent contract. As an Advanced AI Data Trainer at Invisible, I was responsible for supervising and training client AI models for top Tech companies worldwide. I collaborated with a diverse team from around the world to optimize AI algorithms, implementing innovative techniques to enhance model performance and accuracy.</p>
<p>I hold an undergraduate Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and I am currently studying for my Data Analytics in Business Masters Degree at Seattle Pacific University in Seattle, Washington. I will graduate in June, 2027.</p>
